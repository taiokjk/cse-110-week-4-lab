## Question 2
150

## Question 3
150

## Question 4
the function will return an array of discounted prices in the order of the input prices and the discount percentage  
[50, 100, 150]

## Question 5
line 12 returns an error because we use let for i, thus i is not accessible outside of the for loop

## Question 6
line 13 returns an error because we use let for discountedPrice, thus discountedPrice is not accessible outside of the for loop

## Question 7
line 14 returns result of the last finalPrice  
150

## Question 8
the function will return an array of discounted prices in the order of the input prices and the discount percentage  
[50, 100, 150]

## Question 9
line 11 returns an error because we use let for i, thus i is not accessible outside of the for loop

## Question 10
line 12 returns the length of the prices array passed into the function  
3

## Question 11
discounted is declared as an array constant, so pushing elements into the array is a valid operation because discounted is a constant pointer that points to the first element of the array. The function will return an array as normal of discounted prices in the order of the input prices and the discount percentage  
[50, 100, 150]

## Question 12
**A.** student.name  
**B.** student['Grad Year']  
**C.** student.greeting()  
**D.** student['Favorite Teacher'].name)  
**E.** student.courseLoad[0]

## Question 13
**A.** 32. Since the number 2 is mapped to its exact string representation.  
**B.** 1. Since the string '3' is mapped to its numeric representation.  
**C.** 3. Since null is mapped to 0 in its numeric representation  
**D.** 3null. Since null is mapped to its string representation.  
**E.** 4. Since true is mapped to 1 in its numeric representation.  
**F.** 0. Since false is mapped to 0 and null is mapped to 0 in numeric representation.  
**G.** 3undefined. Since undefined is mapped to its string representation.  
**H.** NaN. Since '3' is mapped to 3 in numeric representation, but undefined is mapped to NaN.  

## Question 14
**A.** true. Since '2' is mapped to 2 in numeric representaion, and 2 is greater than 1.  
**B.** false. Since in the first character of both string, '2' is greater than '1'. So, '2' is greater than '12'.  
**C.** true. Since 2 and the numeric representation of '2' are equal.  
**D.** false. Since they are different types.  
**E.** false. Since the numeric representation of true is 1, and 1 is not equal to 2.  
**F.** true. Since Boolean(2) is true and we are comparing the same boolean types.  

## Question 15
The operator == compares the values, whereas the operator === compares both the values and the matching types.

## Question 17
[2, 4, 6]  
First when calling *modifyArray([1, 2, 3], doSomething)*, we passed in an array of 3 numbers and the function *doSomething* as a callback function. For each for-loop iteration, each number in the array is passed into the callback function *doSomething*, which would take that number and multiply it by 2. Then, the result of doSomething is returned and pushed into the array *newArr*. After all iterations are finished, the array *newArr* is returned as the result of the function *modifyArray*.
